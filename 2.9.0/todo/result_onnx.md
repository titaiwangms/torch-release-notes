# Release Notes worksheet onnx

The main goal of this process is to rephrase all the commit messages below to make them **clear and easy to read** by the end user. You should follow the following instructions to do so:

* **Please clean up and format commit titles to be readable by the general PyTorch user.** Make sure you're [following the guidance here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14OmgGBr1w6gl1VO47GGGdwrIaUNr92DFhQbY_NEk8mQ/edit)! Your resulting notes must be consistent and easy to read.
* Please sort commits into the following categories (you should not rename the categories!), I tried to pre-sort these to ease your work, feel free to move commits around if the current categorization is not good.
* Anything that is not public facing needs to be removed.
* If anything is miscategorized/belongs to another domain, move it to `miscategorized.md`.
* Please scan through `miscategorized.md` and handle any commits that belong within your domain according to these instructions.
* We place a lot of emphasis on the “BC-breaking” and “deprecation” sections. Those should be where the most effort goes in. The “improvements” and “bug fixes” for Python API should be nice as well.
* Once you are finished, move this very file from `todo/` to `done/` and submit a pull request.

The categories below are as follows:

* BC breaking: All commits that are BC-breaking. These are the most important commits. If any pre-sorted commit is actually BC-breaking, do move it to this section. Each commit should contain a paragraph explaining the rational behind the change as well as an example for how to update user code [BC-Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14OmgGBr1w6gl1VO47GGGdwrIaUNr92DFhQbY_NEk8mQ/edit#heading=h.a9htwgvvec1m).
* Deprecations: All commits introducing deprecation. Each commit should include a small example explaining what should be done to update user code.
* new_features: All commits introducing a new feature (new functions, new submodule, new supported platform etc)
* improvements: All commits providing improvements to existing feature should be here (new backend for a function, new argument, better numerical stability)
* bug fixes: All commits that fix bugs and behaviors that do not match the documentation
* performance: All commits that are added mainly for performance (we separate this from improvements above to make it easier for users to look for it)
* documentation: All commits that add/update documentation
* Developers: All commits that are not end-user facing but still impact people that compile from source, develop into pytorch, extend pytorch, etc
* not user facing: All commits that are not public end-user facing and hence should be dropped from the release notes

## onnx
### bc breaking
- Default to dynamo export ([#159646](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/159646))
- Set fallback=False by default ([#162726](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/162726))

The ONNX exporter now uses the newer `torch.export.export` pipeline by default (`dynamo=True`). Previously, calling `torch.onnx.export(...)` without arguments used the legacy exporter. This change improves graph fidelity and future-proofs exports, but may surface graph capture errors that were previously masked or handled differently.  

Version 2.8

```python
# API calls the legacy exporter with dynamo=False
torch.onnx.export(...)
```

Version 2.9

```python
# To preserve the original behavior
torch.onnx.export(..., dynamo=False)

# Export onnx model through torch.export.export
torch.onnx.export(...)
```

Recommendation: first try the new default; only fall back if you hit blocking issues and report them upstream. Long term, fix the root cause instead of relying on fallback or torchscript exporter.

- Set default opset to 20 ([#158802](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/158802))

Opset 20 enables newer operator definitions and better alignment with current PyTorch semantics. If your tooling or downstream runtime only supports opset 18, pin it explicitly.  


Version 2.8

```py
# opset_version=18
torch.onnx.export(...)
```

Version 2.9

```py
# To preserve the original behavior
torch.onnx.export(..., opset_version=18)

# New: opset_version=20
torch.onnx.export(...)
```

- Drop draft_export in exporter API ([#161454](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/161454))
- Hide draft export under a flag ([#162225](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/162225))

Clearer behavior and faster failures by removing implicit draft tracing from the default exporter path,
The expensive `torch.export.draft_export` diagnostic path is no longer auto-invoked (which could take hours on large models). You can still opt in for deep diagnostics:

Version 2.8,

```bash
# If both torch.export.export(..., strict=False) and 
# torch.export.export(..., strict=True) fail to capture
# torch IR, torch.export.draft_export(...) will be triggered,
# and uses real tensor to trace/export the model.
# 
# Inside export_to_onnx.py:
#  ... torch.onnx.export(..., dynamo=True)
python export_to_onnx.py
```

Version 2.9,

```bash
# To trigger torch.export.draft_export once
# torch.export.export strcit=True/False both
# fail:

TORCH_ONNX_ENABLE_DRAFT_EXPORT=True python export_to_onnx.py
```

- Delete torch.onnx.dynamo_export ([#158130](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/158130))
- Remove legacy Dort ([#158258](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/158258))

`torch.onnx.dynamo_export` is removed. Please use `torch.onnx.export` instead. 
The experimental ONNX Runtime compile backend (`torch.compile(backend="onnxrt")`) is no longer supported.  

- Refactor torchscript based exporter ([#161323](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/161323))

As we move towards the `torch.export` based exporter, some public facing utility APIs for the torchscript based exporter became private.

- `torch.onnx.symbolic_caffe2` is removed ([#157102](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/157102))
